# Week 1

Prototype 1:

For this week's prototype, I've decided to test a low-fidelity idea of my Capstone proposal.

I asked myself: _What's the simplest form my initial idea can take?_ The answer came from plain journaling -- a paper and a pen.
Since I wanted to make this public, I have chosen two spaces to put up journaling prompts and plain stickers for others to write on -- our dorm room's common area and A5C 4th floor.

The goal is to get other people curious about some stickers on the wall, read the responses of others, and leave a response of their own.

Questions asked:
1. **What has been a highlight of your week?**
2. **Any challenge that you wish to share?**

Another task of this is to foster a "comfortable" (need to think of a better term) space for others to express themselves honestly and freely.
A hope for this public journaling prototype is rooted in the concept of "sentimental education" -- when others learn from each other emotionally.
What kind of emotions does the text evoke? Can we empathize with others? How does reading about others' highlights and challenges make us feel?

Things to reflect upon further:
- Can I potentially collaborate with Health & Wellness or REACH with this? What about my classes? Can this be added to any of my class curriculums?
