# Going into Week 9

## Amina's Pecha Kucha

As a technologist and aspiring researcher, I am interested in creating projects that touch upon themes of time and transformation. Technology is rarely thought of as a medium that can foster and promote mindfulness. In my Capstone, I am investigating how an immersive experience, namely a gamified virtual reality narrative, has capacity to foster a poetic/cinematic experience, in which emotional education becomes a by-product of interaction and immersion. I intend to use immersive sound, storytelling, and elements of play to convey this theme.

# Week 8

## Capstone Updates

### I. Theory

Over the break, I continued to read Jaron Lanier's "Dawn of the New Everything" to understand the theory and meaning behind VR. I know that I want to create a poetic immersive experience, and after discussing it with Prof Slavica, I am set to creating an interactive VR piece. I am also reading chapters on VR cinema from "Remediation: Understanding New Media".

### II. The Story

Just a few days before the break, I have come up with the narrative that I plan to convey in the VR experience. As discussed in class before, it will encompass a few therapeutic methods to bring up memories, savoring, and grounding. With these themes, I intend the experience to be a space for emotional learning happening as a by-product of user interactions.

### III. Implementation

In this second half of the semester, it is good to start drafting the VR environment in Unity. I will plan this in more detail this week with Slavica. For now, I have done some brief research on assets and libraries I can use for implementing the narrative. At the end of the experience, there will be a call to action prompting the user to leave their own story. This can be done through knobs, pictures, or other VR-specific interactions. Some artists and software that I draw inspiration from for this specific part:

- TouchDesign for projection mapping;
- Typewriter assets for VR interactions;
- "Beyond Pages", 1995, by Masaki Fujihata.

### IV. Making

Over the past 7 weeks of making and ideation, I have tried different technology and alternative media to make the capstone. Some of the reflections I had after those are ...

## Concept Updates

As soon as I re-framed my Capstone to a *gamified* experience, the story that I was trying to tell finally came up!

Narrative draft open for feedback and comments: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4XEmVogyfyKl-tg2vu4GUgE0bVsHYSt_7lMLVtgoGM/edit?usp=sharing

What I am trying to do through the narrative is (1) foster an experience for reflection, (2) create an environment for expression, (3) show how each one of us is capable for using mindfulness techniques when things get hectic in life; how one can learn to slow down and help themselves navigate through a rough patch with the skills and experiences learned in the gamified immersive narrative.

Because the story and the experience rely heavily on senses -- with audio and visuals -- it might be helpful to have it in VR as it allows for more immersive experiences. I also envision it on the web, but it might be less powerful in environmental storytelling.

# Week 5

## Making

My project is about sharing stories and meaningful memories from life. Anonymously or not, with and through technology. This week I created an AR prototype of such a "story", a quote from Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. I've used app called Artivive and Canva to create the graphics + animations.

![](/media/2.png)
![](/media/instructions.jpg)
![](/media/quote.gif)

The idea is that people see a poster (right now it's in a low-fidelity test version -- will probably be iterated over), see the instructions on how to scan it, and then scan it to see the hidden message.

I have tested it with one of my friends before leaving the posters in the Library. The feedback I got was that it's a bit unclear what they're supposed to do and how to scan. So I added extra steps in the instructions mannual on how to download the app and scan it. Perhaps the AR animation needs less text and slower speed for better comprehension. I can fix that in the next iteration should I choose to stick with AR.

A good thing about Artivive is that I can track the metrics of people who scanned the image to see the AR pop-up. So if I leave the posters, I will be able to see how many people have scanned it, which is good for research and citing purposes.

# Week 3-4

Date Sep 21:

Reflections: political situation in the world since Jan 2022 [deadly and violent protests in Kazakhstan] had a huge impact on my life, and I can't stay silent about it. Central Asian politics is complex, and with the invasion of Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, it is even more so...As a creator, how can I make space to honor people going through these experiences?

## Capstone Ideation Progress

Date: Sep 18

→ Root project on the experience itself. perhaps not so much on storytelling and learning. learn by doing. not learn by learning.

→ Website: bottles and shelves. clicking on bottles. it opens up. you read the story. perhaps the story is voice-narrated. the story is about opening up and vulnerability. a childhood memory. a happy moment. an intimate moment. a sad moment. letting go. sharing. amplifying. savoring.

→ What do I want to foster post the experience? Sense of relief. Sense of belonging. Joy. Ease. Betterment. Love. Sharing. Feeling something from reading the posts of others. Empathizing. Being compassionate. **Responding?** Dialogue? Interactions with each other?

Idea: what if there is a physical component to it as well? after completing the first stage? Like a small room in which there are the same bottles with the main note + any of the responses from the audience. How would that change the feel of the experience?

## Reflectons on IM and artist/work journey:

→ My journey to IM has not been linear. I took classes from different majors here and there, but always had this passion for something not related to one particular theme. I liked design, colors, and was decent with STEM, and decided to try IM because I’ve heard it combined all of those things. It was love at first sight. From the very first class of Intro to IM, I was very much hooked into the process. Although it happened more intuitively at first, I think now I begin to realize why. I have always struggled with expressing myself verbally to the outside world (personal reason to me), but with interactive experiences, it feels easier. **Colors, sounds, code, input and output** — all of these things are so multifaceted and create so much room for exploration. I love creating, exploring, researching — letting the process immerse me — and that brings joy. This is what IM does to me.
→ What I like is problem-solving and intentional decision making

### My life

- I was born in Astana, Kazakhstan. Central Asia. Post-USSR. Post-colonialism. New country. Nomads. Islam.
- I have lived in Astana, Tennessee, Abu Dhabi, New York, Los Angeles / California, London
- I consider myself a **creative technologist.** Sometimes, a software engineer, experience designer, educator, VR programmer, HCI professional, researcher.
- I studied IM with coursework in computer engineering and math.
- I was first introduced to art at elementary school, but more informally, I was introduced to web-design and programming (unknowingly) as a teenager when I was exploring the idea of having and curating an online web page. This was later dropped as any career idea until NYUAD, where I found that I can combine art and technology — and many other things — for my enjoyment and **greater good**.
    - Elaborate on this idea of social impact.
- Major obstacles — speech impediment. Growing up in Central Asia. Learning to navigate non-inclusive world before finding more belonging and acceptance elsewhere.

### My "art"

- Themes present in artwork — emotional education, VR, empathy, compassion — trying not to limit myself here. Perhaps many more, just need to dig and reflect deeper. Expression!
    - education, psychology, social good in my works. Fun interactive technologies. Games.
- What is unique about my technique is that I express myself and my background while also creating tools for others to express themselves. I like to explore the themes of education, psychology, social good in my works. Fun interactive technologies. Games.
- Topic that I want to convey to my users — empathy, compassion, reflection and understanding, self-expression, emotional education. I want to make experiences that are inclusive and accessible, too.
- The first thing people notice about my art — VR and empathy.

### Accomplishments

- Google scholarship
- Internship with Goldman Sachs
- Fellowship with TOM
- Microsoft Learn + Women @ Dior
- Multiple VR projects and research while at NYUAD — IM showcase
- Media talks and interviews on Kazakhstani resources

## Personal Statement

Can technology help us live more mindfully? How can I, as a technology-maker, create experiences that foster spaces for empathy and compassion?

These are the guiding questions in my work as a researcher, designer, and engineer.

I grew up with a speech condition that affected my ability to socialize and communicate from the early age. I quickly learned that if I want to be heard, I must find a way to communicate differently. Through learning the art of self-expression, I have found my way to creative technology. 

Expressing myself with alternative forms of communication media carried me to pursue my studies in Interactive Media at the New York University in Abu Dhabi and to finding my passion for technology design and making. From creating storytelling art projects to virtual reality games with code, I have learned to embrace my curiosity and life experiences to enable expression.

Fostered empathy and compassion through my personal circumstance has opened up many professional opportunities to me. Aside from being a software engineer and a creative technologist, I like to work with disability communities across the globe to make accessible and open-source technology solutions for a better, more inclusive living. This is something I focused on as a 2021-2022 Tikkun Olam Makers Fellow in Abu Dhabi and New York City and want to continue doing throughout my education in the greater community.

In addition, I have discovered that concepts of empathy, along with other frameworks used in positive psychology, run through most of my work. After reflecting on why that happens to be the case, I came to realize that I refuse to simply make technology for the sake of it. It needs to be intentional, and I see it at the intersection of education, technology, and expression.

For me, expression comes in writing and sharing, too. Because my career has led me to live, learn, and work from different locations, I have a privilege of getting a greater perspective on inclusive education and workspaces across the globe. Born and raised in Kazakhstan, I went off to the United States and the United Arab Emirates as a student to learn more about inclusive education, and later to the United Kingdom to experience the accessible workspace culture. It is my honor to contribute to the world of diversity, equity and inclusion with my column on Women Rewriting the Code and share my learnings in hopes they will bring value and ease to people going through similar experiences. 

In my work, I explore themes of empathy and compassion nurtured through technology. Expressing myself was a challenge when I was growing up, and my academic career is centered around that. I want to create products that are not just beautiful, fun, and engaging — I want to intentionally craft experiences that are meaningful and are bigger than myself.


# Week 2-3

## Sep 10-13

Prototype 2:

**Open-Sourcing Capstone!**(kind of)

![](/media/amina.JPG)
![](/media/board-1.JPG)

After observing not-so-much participation with the Prototype 1 (even from my own roommates!), I've decided to try a different approach. What makes a fun interactive activity? I asked this question on a public white-board near the IM lounge in the Arts Center. Near this space, I've also placed a version of my previous prompt -- How are you feeling today? -- instead of "What's been a highlight/challenge of your week?"

Soon as the audience has identified their emotion, it’s easier to elaborate on it, providing better context and info for savoring. This is “preparation” / “nudging” for the main experience…

Now, jokes are funny, but my project isn’t about humor. So the concept of *fun*, in this sense, is better referred to as “engaging”? “interactive?” “captivating?” — but these are now philosophical experiences…what is a **captivating** experience?

Topics to explore:

- social-emotional learning
- [Immersive experience](https://www.google.com/search?q=dreamscapes+slc&sxsrf=ALiCzsZxvdPPNjzHhS6AUUigKql1lT7oQQ:1662802624852&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvpKS-9on6AhVDy6QKHXw0BTYQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1440&bih=690&dpr=2) - from places like Meow Wolf or other theme parks

My notes:
## **what is fun?**

- **emojis**
- notion
- habit tracker
- texting
- public displays
- body interactions
- drawing
- pets
- Arduino buttons
- electronics input/output
- music
- symbols
- games
- **seeing aesthetic animations**
- **following a storyline**
- forest app

# Week 1

## Sep 4

Prototype 1:

For this week's prototype, I've decided to test a low-fidelity idea of my Capstone proposal.

I asked myself: _What's the simplest form my initial idea can take?_ The answer came from plain journaling -- a paper and a pen.
Since I wanted to make this public, I have chosen two spaces to put up journaling prompts and plain stickers for others to write on -- our dorm room's common area and A5C 4th floor.

The goal is to get other people curious about some stickers on the wall, read the responses of others, and leave a response of their own.

Questions asked:
1. **What has been a highlight of your week?**
2. **Any challenge that you wish to share?**

Another task of this is to foster a "comfortable" (need to think of a better term) space for others to express themselves honestly and freely.
A hope for this public journaling prototype is rooted in the concept of "sentimental education" -- when others learn from each other emotionally.
What kind of emotions does the text evoke? Can we empathize with others? How does reading about others' highlights and challenges make us feel?

Things to reflect upon further:
- Can I potentially collaborate with Health & Wellness or REACH with this? What about my classes? Can this be added to any of my class curriculums?
